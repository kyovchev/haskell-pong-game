# Haskell Pong Game

This repository contains the source code of a Pong game developed on Haskell.

The game will be developed in the final weeks of the Functional Programming course for the Information Systems bachelor's program at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of Sofia University.

The final state of the game after each week is contained within the corresponding folder.

The development process starts with an introduction of the packaging system. Then, continues with adding the more functionalities to the game: from basic game logic up to an AI opponent.

The code in the folder [./week_01/](./week_01/) is tested on Windows 11 Home 24H2, Ubuntu 24.04.2 and MacOS 10.15.7 (Catalina).
